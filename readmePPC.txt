Assignment statement (as provided by Prof Joy Monteiro, ECS Department, IISER Pune):

Identify years with El-Ninos and La Ninas in the dataset and compare and contrast the TOA, SFC and CLD datasets for the Decembers of these years. Based on your understanding and reading of ENSO, try and interpret the differences you observe. (To contrast two different years, you can use simple subtraction).

My methods of analysis include visualising deviations of radiative fluxes, cloud cover and effective cloud temperature from December climatology for El Nino and La Nina years (both as a function of only latitude, and latitude and longitude), and finding the correlation between these different deviations for El Nino and La Nina years. I then attempt to explain these results based on current knowledge of ENSO.

As of 1st Feb 20213, this assignment is still in progress! This is extremely preliminary analysis, and requires far more careful treatment.
